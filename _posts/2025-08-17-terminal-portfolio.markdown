I am excited to introduce my new project: [Terminal Portfolio](https://terminal.baird.dev). This website emulates a terminal system to showcase my CV and projects in an interactive and unique way. Built with JavaScript, it provides a sleek and modern interface for visitors to explore my professional background.

The deployment of this project was handled using **Cloudflare Workers**, a serverless platform that allows for fast and scalable hosting. By leveraging Cloudflare's global network, the website ensures low latency and high availability for users around the world. The Workers platform also simplifies the deployment process, making it seamless to push updates and maintain the site.

Feel free to visit [Terminal Portfolio](https://terminal.baird.dev) and explore its features. I hope you enjoy the experience as much as I enjoyed building it!
